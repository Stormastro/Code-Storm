The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income. The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners).

The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/acs1","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSDT1Y2012","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2018-07-04 00:00:00.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2012,"c_dataset":["acs","flows"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2012\/acs\/flows\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isAggregate":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"2008-2012 American Community Survey: Migration Flows","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"Migration flows are derived from the relationship between the location of current residence in the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the responses given to the migration question \"Where did you live 1 year ago?\".

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSDT1Y2013","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2018-07-04 00:00:00.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2013,"c_dataset":["acs","acs1","subject"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs1\/subject\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isAggregate":true,"c_isCube":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"ACS 1-Year Subject Tables","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services.

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds.

For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/acsse","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSSE2015","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2018-07-06 00:00:00.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2015,"c_dataset":["acs","flows"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2015\/acs\/flows\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isAggregate":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"2011-2015 American Community Survey: Migration Flows","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"Migration flows are derived from the relationship between the location of current residence in the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the responses given to the migration question \"Where did you live 1 year ago?\".

The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2017\/acs\/acs1\/profile","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSDP1Y2017","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2018-09-06 00:00:00.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2018,"c_dataset":["pdb","blockgroup"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/pdb\/blockgroup\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isAggregate":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"2018 Census Planning Database: Block Group","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"The PDB is a database of U.S. housing, demographic, socioeconomic and operational statistics based on select 2010 Decennial Census and select  5-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates.

In order to implement provisions under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as amended, we produce total population, number of children ages 5 to 17, and number of related children ages 5 to 17 in families in poverty estimates for school districts.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/poverty\/saipe\/schdist","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates","hasEmail":"mailto:sehsd.saipe@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/SAIPESCHOOLDISTRICTS","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2019-12-02 09:30:03.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_dataset":["timeseries","intltrade","exports","statehs"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/timeseries\/intltrade\/exports\/statehs\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isTimeseries":true,"c_isCube":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Time Series International Trade: Monthly U.S. Exports by State and Harmonized System (HS) Code","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"The Census data API provides access to the most comprehensive set of data on current month and cumulative year-to-date exports by state and Harmonized System (HS) code.

The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census.

The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.  Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2008\/acs\/acs3","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSDT3Y2008","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2019-08-28 09:07:18.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2018,"c_dataset":["acs","acs5","subject"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2018\/acs\/acs5\/subject\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isAggregate":true,"c_isCube":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"ACS 5-Year Subject Tables","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services.

To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords the states an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.  Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2013\/acs\/acs3\/profile","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSDP3Y2013","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2020-01-28 15:59:11.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2020,"c_dataset":["pdb","statecounty"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/pdb\/statecounty\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isAggregate":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"2020 Planning Database - State and County Level","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"This is a one-time release of the Census Bureau\u2019s Planning Database (PDB).

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds.

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2019\/acs\/acsse","description":"API endpoint","format":"API","mediaType":"application\/json","title":"API endpoint"}],"contactPoint":{"fn":"American Community Survey Office","hasEmail":"mailto:Acso.users.support@census.gov"},"identifier":"https:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/id\/ACSSE2019","keyword":["census"],"license":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/","modified":"2020-04-03 00:00:00.0","programCode":["006:004"],"references":["https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developers\/"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Census Bureau","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department Of Commerce","subOrganizationOf":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Government"}}}},{"c_vintage":2020,"c_dataset":["cps","basic","jul"],"c_geographyLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/geography.json","c_variablesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/variables.json","c_tagsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/tags.json","c_examplesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/examples.json","c_groupsLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/groups.json","c_sorts_url":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/sorts.json","c_valuesLink":"http:\/\/api.census.gov\/data\/2020\/cps\/basic\/jul\/values.json","c_documentationLink":"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/developer\/","c_isMicrodata":true,"c_isCube":true,"c_isAvailable":true,"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Current Population Survey: Basic Monthly","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["006:07"],"description":"To provide estimates of employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the general labor force, of the population as a whole, and of various subgroups of the population.

Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw districts for the United States Congress and state legislature. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.

The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of \u201c72\u201d. The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.
